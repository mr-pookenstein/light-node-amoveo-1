Amoveo light node vStablecoin
========

This is a light node for the Amoveo cryptocurrency and is meant to be used to try out testnet BTC stablecoins. The idea is that you can effectively convert VEO into BTC using this market. This is meant to test out functionality and there may be significant bugs. In fact there is a high chance of something going wrong, so lower your expectations.

You can either download the light node from this repository, or you can just access it from here: http://18.222.121.248:8070/stablecoin.html

INSTRUCTIONS:

First time users:

5. in the stablecoin market, fill out the fields with a veo/btc price, an amount of veo, and click long or short. short means you want a stablecoin, long means you want to go long veobtc. hit "Place order".
6. you can click "calculate positions" to see if your order has been filled yet. "check balance" checks your channel balance.
              
              An order to short 1 VEO at 0.025 veobtc that has been filled looks like this:

              If this same order wasn't filled, it would look like this:
                      POSITION - Value: -1 VEO, Entry Price: 0.025
